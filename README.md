Final project for RPI ECSE 4966.
Goal was to gather a custom dataset of Minecraft Gameplay + input tracking to fine-tune the Oasis model to encourage it to try to kill the user.

However, this project was ultimately a failure since the open-source Oasis model is really really bad.
Luckily though, my data collection script is still useful (see Minecraft_Recording.py).
